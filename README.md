The Custom Career Advice Chatbot provides tailored job and career guidance for Pakistani students, using RAG to retrieve relevant information from career-related PDFs or web data (e.g., job market trends, resume tips). Built with LangChain, a free Hugging Face LLM (e.g., LLaMA), and FAISS for vector storage, it will be deployed as a Streamlit web app. It is practical for local needs.
